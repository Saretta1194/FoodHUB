## Deployment - Heroku

The subsequent actions were carried out to facilitate the deployment of this page to Heroku from its corresponding GitHub repository:

### Create the Heroku App

- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labeled "New" in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next, select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

### Attach the Postgres database

- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.

### Prepare the environment and settings.py file

- In your workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
- Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
- Comment out the default database configuration.
- Save files and make migrations.
- Add Cloudinary URL to env.py.
- Add the Cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps.
- Add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url, and default file storage path.
- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR.
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list.

### Create files/directories

- Create requirements.txt file.
- Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage, and templates.
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi.

### Update Heroku Config Vars

Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:

- SECRET_KEY = yoursecretkey
- CLOUDINARY_URL = yourcloudinaryurl
- PORT = 8000
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

### Deploy

- NB: Ensure in Django settings, DEBUG is False
- Go to the deploy tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository.
- Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the repo is updated.
- Click View to view the deployed site.

The site is now live and operational.

## Bugs  

- Fixed login redirect loop by configuring `LOGIN_URL`.  
- Adjusted navbar to display correct links per role (customer/owner/rider).  
- Fixed crispy forms rendering on signup/profile pages.  
- Fixed delivery status flow to block invalid transitions.
